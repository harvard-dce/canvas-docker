# # Canvas currently works without Redis, however some features require Redis and will be disabled.
# # Redis can also be used as a replacement for memcache, for both session store and caching.
#
# # The recommended setup is to define your redis server(s) in this file, and
# # then in cache_store.yml specify cache_store: redis_store without any servers
# # listed, which will tell Canvas to use this same server list.
#
production:
  servers:
    # list of redis servers to use in the ring
    - "redis://<%= ENV['REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR'] %>:<%= ENV['REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT'] %>"

test:
  # only tests that are exercising the integration with redis require redis to run.
  servers:
    - redis://localhost
  # warning: the redis database will get cleared before each test, so if you
  # use this server for anything else, make sure to set aside a database id for
  # these tests to use.
